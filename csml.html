Welcome to the CSML docs.<br>CSML is a tool to create websites using C#. It is made to be as light as possible and featureless as possible since i have no time.<br><br>The documentation will be about the various ways you can use CSML! Such as, creating websites (like this one :O), C# application ui (WOAH) and ofcourse <br><br>These docs will also explain how everything works! and how it is all held together with cheap 2 dollar glue</p><p class='box left'>Index:<br><a href="#1"> 1. How it works  </a><br><a href="#2"> 2. Installation </a><br><a href="#3"> 3. Usage  </a><br><a href="#3.1"> 3.1 Creating CSML using CSML++  </a></p></div><div id='1' class='center unselectable box1 bg1'><h1 class='title'>How it works:</h1><p class='unselectable cursor box left'>CSML works by converting most tags of HTML into C# objects.<br><br>There is a base class called Element which has a few properties which will be the basis for every other element.<br>In actual tags, for example H1 there will be a constructor with a few parameters based on the tag. The H1 tag has 2 constructor elements, a string for text, and a list of elements for children which is automatically set to null.<br><br>Now imagine that for 100 tags, yeah.<br><br>That is the basis on CSML, I will go in more detail below.</p><p class='unselectable cursor box left'>The base class element has 14 properties that are used.<br>1 ToString: Gets the tag and returns the name.<br><br>2 Tag: This is the identifier used to identify it, so a H1 tag would have the tag... h1...<br><br>3 ToHTML: This converts itself into a HTML object, so a h1 element would go from <br>new H1("Hello World") to &lt;h1&gt;Hello World&lt/h1&gt;, and it also goes through all children and calls the same function.<br><br>4 id: Same as HTML id.<br><br>5 @class: Same as HTML classes.<br><br>6 style: Same as HTML styles.<br><br>7 innerHTML: Same as HTML innerHTML.<br>8 children: These are the children in the form of other element classes.<br><br>9 randomId: I had trouble using JSON serialization and reloading it back into an object, so i used a GUID for identification.<br><br>10 href: Same as HTML href.<br><br>11 name: Not used in HTML, but used in CSML++ for identifying itself in the treeview. <br><br>12 ChangeProperty: Takes in the same arguments as the constructor for a new element BUT it returns itself so you can keep calling ChangeProperty.<br><br>13: Clone: Clones itself, used for the CSML++ treeview cloning in the rightclick menu.<br>These were all the properties of the Element class, I will not go through each tag since the names of the constructor arguments should correlate with the arguments that are used in the corresponding html tags. </p></div><div id='2' class='center unselectable box1 bg1'><h1 class='title'>Installation:</h1><p class='unselectable cursor box left'>Installation of CSML is not hard.<br>1. Go to https://github.com/MartinPrograms/CSML/ and download it as zip.<br>2. Browse to csml_lib > bin > debug > net7.0<br>3. Copy the files and put them in a different folder you will remember.<br>4. Reference the DLL csml_lib.dll in your C# project<br>5. Profit! </p></div><div id='3' class='center unselectable box1 bg1'><h1 class='title'>Usage:</h1><p class='unselectable cursor box left'>Usage of CSML is not that hard using C#.<br><br>In C# create a new console application, in that console application reference the CSML lib dll.<br><br>Here is an example of CSML:<br><br>var csml = new CSML(new Element[]<br>{<br>// Create a div<br>new Div(new List<Element>()<br>{<br>// Create a button<br>new A("https://atomyc.me/csml", "Learn CSML")<br>})<br>});<br>Now we can export this to a HTML file using csml.GetHTML("WebPageTitle!", "optionalCssFileName.css");<br>And that will export our beautiful website to a HTML string, which we can then load in a webbrowser.</p></div><div id='3.1' class='center unselectable box1 bg1'><h1 class='title'>Creating CSML using CSML++:</h1><p class='unselectable cursor box left'>Introduction:<br><br>CSML++ is a tool i created to see how hard it would be to create a visual designer for CSML.<br><br>It turned out to be very very easy, so i decided to expand on it and it resulted in this tool. It still has many kinks but it is by far the best way to use CSML so far.<br>I made all websites i have using CSML++, it is really fast to use and because i have access to the source i can mold it to my needs.<br><br>Installing CSML++:<br><br>1. Download CSML from the link provided in <a href="#2">the installation</a><br>2. Browse to csml++ > bin > Release > net7.0-windows<br>3. Run the exe called "csml++.exe" with the CSML logo.<br><br>Using CSML++:<br>CSML++ in its current state has many bugs and issues causing it to be sometimes pretty backward to use sadly.<br><br>Creating a new project:<br>When you open the CSML++ executable you will see the project loader form, the listbox at the left side contains a list of all projects you have ever made.<br>The top most text bar shows the current selected project.<br><br>In the new project group you can decide to create a new project in 2 different ways, from scratch or from a CSML file.<br>Making one from scratch writes a default CSML file to the selected folder. Creating one from a CSML file does the same except replaces the content of the website, it does NOT transfer css files or js files.<br><br>The show special button allows you to load and or export projects from special ways, currently there is only one way which is a CSML object from text. This object can then be used to be exported as text or as a CSML object.</p></div><footer class='bg1 unselectable box1 center'><h4><a href='#1'>Home</a><a href='#2'> Installation </a><a href='#3'> Usage </a><a href='#3.1'>CSML++ Usage</a></h4><p>Made using CSML++ and CSML <br> Mart!n#4834 - Atomyc</p></footer></body></body><script src='source.js'></script></html>
